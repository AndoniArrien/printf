# 02-ft_printf

## Overview

The **ft_printf** project challenges you to create your own version of the `printf()` function, called `ft_printf()`, mimicking the behavior of the original `printf()` from the C Standard Library. This project is designed to test your understanding of variadic functions and string formatting.

## Project Details

### ft_printf() Function

- **Prototype:** `int ft_printf(const char *, ...)`
- **Conversions to Handle:** cspdiuxX%

## Bonus Part

While not mandatory, you have the option to implement additional features:

- Manage any combination of the flags: `-0.` and the field minimum width under all conversions.
- Manage all the following flags: `# +` (Yes, one of them is a space).
